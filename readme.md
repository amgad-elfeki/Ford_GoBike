# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Amgad Elfeki


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The source data (Ford GoBike System Data) is available at: https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, it was noted that the dataset had 183412 rides that were made by 4646 different bikes. It was found that the average duration trip for these rides ranges from 1 minute upto 100 minutes and the longest trip took about 25000 minutes. Those trips were mostly made by males who formed 71.2% of the whole Gobike's users. Accrpdongly, the subscribers also had majority male subscribers who were also more than 60% of the whole subscribers.
It was also pretty clear during the analysis, that the longest trips were made by users who were in their 30s, and most of these long trips were made by users who are not subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the trips' duration and the category of users who made these trips. I started off with a histogram showing the average durations of the trips, then barcharts were used to analyze the gender of the users and if they are subscribed to the service or not.

Afterwards, I started linking between those users and the trips' durations user scatterplots.
